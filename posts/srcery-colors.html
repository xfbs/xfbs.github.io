  <p>This week I had to set up a bunch of things for work. Since I spend a lot of time on the command line, I wanted to make it look comfortable. At first, I went with the default of black text on a white background, but soon enough I got tired of that. It’s more comfortable to look at a darker background. So I played around a bit and tried switching things around, but it never looked just right.</p>

<p>I need to get things to a state where I’m comfortable using them, but I want to refrain from customizing things too much, because it’s too much of a distration. It’s better to use things as they are out-of-the-box, or maybe install a little plugin, but I don’t really want to have to manually tweak things.</p>

<p>Instead of tweaking the default colors, I decided to install the <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/">solarized</a> colorscheme that I had used before on some machines. But even that didn’t look quite right. Not wanting to spend too much time on this, I went out and googled for some colorschemes, and almost immediately I found <a href="https://vimcolors.com">vimcolors</a>, which is so awesome because you can see all schemes in action.</p>

<p>It didn’t take me long to find the colorscheme that I liked, because to me it stood out with a very crafty and balanced palette, and some nice earthy colors that are so easy on the eyes. So I went ahead and checked out <a href="https://srcery-colors.github.io">srcery</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/srcery-vim.png" alt="Srcery theme in vim" /></p>

<p>It is a package with theme files not just for vim but also for Terminal.app, tmux, and a bunch of other apps. Easy to install, and they work together great.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/srcery-bash.png" alt="Srcery theme in bash" /></p>

<p>I can highly recommend this theme to anyone. It’s very easy on the eyes, and I think I will be using it for the forseeable future. But if you don’t happen to like it, <a href="https://vimcolors.com">vimcolors</a> is an awesome project where you can just casually browse around and discover new colorschemes that you may like.</p>
